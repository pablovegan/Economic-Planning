## References

This package is inspired by Hagberg's and Zacharia's receding horizon planning [repository](https://github.com/lokehagberg/rhp) and Hagberg's [thesis](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1730354/FULLTEXT01.pdf).

Great Python packages exist for input-output analysis, such as [Pymrio](https://github.com/IndEcol/pymrio), altough it is not focused on planning.
